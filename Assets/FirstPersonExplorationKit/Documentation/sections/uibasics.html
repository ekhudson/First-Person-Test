<h2>First Person Exploration Kit: UI Overview</h3>

<p>The core UI consists of some basic information and feedback. Depending on what the player is looking at, what they are holding, etc. the UI changes.</p>

<p>By default, the neutral UI (when player is not looking at any Interactable object) is fairly minimal, as shown below:</p>

<p>But, when the player is holding an Inventory Item, and looking at an Activate type object:</p>

<p>And when the player is examining an object in their hand, the UI is hidden entirely, as shown below:</p>
