<h2>First Person Exploration Kit: Interaction Management</h2>

<br/>

<p>The Interaction Manager handles all core interaction logic and actions. It also has several key UI elements assigned to its prefab (FPEInteractionManager.prefab)</p>

<h3><u>Element Breakdown</u></h3>

<p>The core UI elements are layed out below in detail along with a visual representation of their on screen context and meaning:</p>

<br/>

<table class="inspectorfields">
<tr class="odd">
<td>Reticle (A)</td><td>The reticle Image reacts to interaction possibilities. When the reticle is over top of an Interactable object, it changes to indicate the interaction is available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>InteractionTextLabel (B)</td><td>This Text element content changes based on the Interactable item, and the context of that interaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Control Hints (e.g. UndockHint, etc.) (C)</td><td>These Text and Image hints use the FPEUIHint component to show and hide themselves, as well as change text based on interaction context and available actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NotificationLabel (D)</td><td>This Text element is shown when the player retrieves an Attached Note.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>AudioDiarySkipHintLabel (E)</td><td>This Text and Image element displays the 'skip diary' option to the player. It only appears when a diary is playing, and disappears when the diary is skipped or finishes playing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AudioDiaryTitleLabel (F)</td><td>This Text element displays the title of the currently playing Audio Diary, along with some optional pre- and post-text.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br/>

<p>The JournalBackground contains Text and Image elements used in displaying and reading Journal pages. It is only shown when the player interacts with a Journal.</p>

<br/>

<table class="inspectorfields">
<tr class="odd">
<td>JournalPage (G)</td><td>The Image element that houses each Journal Page as defined in the Inspector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JournalBackground (H)</td><td>This Image element simply provides a black background to support the overall UI design.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>NextButton (I)</td><td>This button moves the Journal forward one page (if allowed).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PreviousButton (J)</td><td>This button moves the Journal back one page (if allowed).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>CloseIndicator (K)</td><td>This Image element displays a button hint showing how the journal can be closed.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br/>


<span class="note"><u>Note</u>: It is possible to add or remove elements to the Interaction Manager UI. However, you will need to do some customization to 
the FPEInteractionManagerScript file. While there are a few areas to change, special focus must be given to the updateControlHints() function, as it 
controls most of the content based on context.</span>
